.. py:function:: sort_ds(dataset)

   Sorts the data values in the dataset

   Ensures that profiles are in the following order:

   * Earlier before later (time will increase)
   * Southerly before northerly (latitude will increase)
   * Westerly before easterly (longitude will increase)

   The two xy sorts are esentially tie breakers for when we are missing "time"

   Inside profiles:

   * Shallower before Deeper (pressure will increase)
